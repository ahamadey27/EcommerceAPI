# Frontend Browser Access Troubleshooting

## Current Status ✅
- **Frontend HTTPS**: `https://localhost:7045` 
- **Frontend HTTP**: `http://localhost:5045`
- **API**: `https://localhost:7155`

## Browser Access Issues & Solutions

### Option 1: Try HTTP Version First (Easier)
Open: **`http://localhost:5045`**
- This avoids SSL certificate issues
- Should work immediately in most browsers

### Option 2: Fix HTTPS Certificate Issues
If you want to use HTTPS (`https://localhost:7045`):

1. **Chrome/Edge:**
   - Visit `https://localhost:7045`
   - You'll see "Your connection is not private"
   - Click **"Advanced"**
   - Click **"Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"**

2. **Firefox:**
   - Visit `https://localhost:7045`
   - You'll see "Warning: Potential Security Risk"
   - Click **"Advanced..."**
   - Click **"Accept the Risk and Continue"**

### Option 3: Clear Browser Data
If it's still not working:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Try a different browser

### Option 4: Check Firewall/Antivirus
- Temporarily disable Windows Firewall
- Check if antivirus is blocking local connections
- Add exceptions for ports 7045 and 5045

## Recommended Testing Order:
1. ✅ **Start here**: `http://localhost:5045` (HTTP - no certificate issues)
2. Test registration/login functionality
3. Once working, optionally switch to HTTPS: `https://localhost:7045`

## If Still Not Working:
- Try VS Code's built-in Simple Browser (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Simple Browser")
- Check Windows Event Viewer for any blocking/security logs
- Try running PowerShell as Administrator and test: `Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:5045`
